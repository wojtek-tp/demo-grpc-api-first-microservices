This folder would typically contain the code for the microservice that the producer team works on.
The producer team creates the microservice that exposes the gRPC service that the consumers can connect to.

We simplify this demo by providing microservice-like applications with a user interface instead of having real microservices that we would have to build.

The sources of this application are available here https://github.com/wojciechbulaty/examples/tree/master/grpc-shop
